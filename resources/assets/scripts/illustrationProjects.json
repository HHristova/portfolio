        "intro": "<p>The very first drawing project I did in the university was to create this children's book. The story, the strange characters and the illustrations were created by me.</p><p>The three main characters were created from different everyday objects: the first one - 'Spoty' was created by using a TV, windows and a drawer; the second character - 'Marple' was created from an old style street lamp, a women's purse and a meter; the last character - 'The Balloon' was created from a balloon, a laptop and skates. It was very creative and funny process and it led to unexpected results.</p><p>The main story of the book was about the university of the most clever people in a town called 'Cleverland'. The three main characters are teachers at the university and they fight a lot about everything. One day the rector calls them all in his office and told him that they need to stop fighting and start working on something big as a discovery in the educational field. For this, he is going to send them to meet the old wise man to help them achieve that. There are some adventures happening along the way, when our characters start to help each other and at the end they realised that they don't need a wise man to let them know how to work together. So they come back to Cleverland and do their most amazing educational discovery for the town.</p><p>I drew the illustrations by hand, using watercolor pencils, pens and markers. ‚úèÔ∏è</p><p>There are the initial pencil sketches for all the book:</p>",

The list included llama, panda, koala, penguin and corgi dog. ü¶ôüêºüê∂</p> <p>The color palette consists of pastel colors with lots of color variations for each illustration.
