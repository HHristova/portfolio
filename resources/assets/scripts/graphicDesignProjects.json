        "intro": "<p>Ladies and gents - my first CD cover design! The genre of the album is a mix between jazz, beatbox, pop and electronic sound. And since all the process of music creation was done in an analog way, the musician Georgi Iliev needed something simple and cosmic inspired in order to present the overall music concept.</p><p>I've started exploring the idea of using some liquid patterns as background elements and combining them with a stardust. The main request was to create something in a purple color range so I've stick to that in the design process. I agreed with the idea of using purple color since it represents the high energy and vibrations as well as it's often used to present the universe and other cosmic topics.</p><p>The color for the title was selected in order to have a strong visual contrast with the overall purple vision and the white sunglasses added an extra spice to the overall design.</p>",

        "intro": "<p>Dolna Malina is a small village located at 28km away from Sofia's city center. The festival started in 2016 and it's main aim is to promote and help young and ambitious people in the fields of <strong>art, sport and education</strong> with plenty of activies and competitions. The festival works in collaboration with <strong>BUFO film studios</strong> and every year the main income from the festival goes for <strong>charity to Rehabilitation center for blind people 'Gorna Malina'</strong>.</p><p>For it's fifth edition, I became part of the main organisation team and I had to came up with an overall brand concept since there was no such thing in previous editions.</p> <p>üé® I've started with the idea of using the green color as a main one because it represents the grass, the meadows and the open fields where the main festival activies take place. From there on, the yellow color comes as a complementary one and it creates the initial color palette for the festival. During the process there were a few more colors that were added as secondaries to the overall design concept.</p><p>üñäÔ∏è In terms of font families I've decided to go with two options - one for the main titles and one for the smaller texts all over the print materials and the website of the festival. For the main title of the festival I draw the name by hand since I wanted to give it more custom and memorable look.</p><p>üñºÔ∏è In order to make the overall branding more recognisable and interesting for the visitors, I've created a set of different illustrations, related to the main activities on the festival. The illustrations follow the idea of quirky and fun branding that can stay out from the rest of the festivals in the area and stick to the main color palette. The reddish shadow at the bottom adds additional accent to the elements without being too intrusive.</p>",
