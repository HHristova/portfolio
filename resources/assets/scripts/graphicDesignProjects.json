        "intro": "<p>The genre of the album is a mix between jazz, beatbox, pop and electronic sound. And since all the process of music creation was done in an analog way, the musician Georgi Iliev needed something simple and cosmic inspired in order to present the overall music concept.</p><p>I've started exploring the idea of using some liquid patterns as background elements and combining them with a stardust. The main request was to create something in a purple color range so I've stick to that in the design process. I agreed with the idea of using purple color since it represents the high energy and vibrations as well as it's often used to present the universe and other cosmic topics.</p><p>The color for the title was selected in order to have a strong visual contrast with the overall purple vision and the white sunglasses added an extra spice to the overall design.</p>",

        "additionalContent": "The concept of the yellow CD is to present the sun and to be the strongest accent in the whole piece, while on the left side the singer is cycling towards it. Below the CD there is a quote regarding the universe from one of the songs in the album <br><br><i>'The universe is constantly expanding<br>and so is the distance between us<br>and the only my oposition of this law is loving.'</i><br><br>and it gives a great finish of the whole concept. 🪐🎵",
