Hey there, 
My name is Hristina Hristova and I am currently working as a Web Designer & Front-End Developer in british company, based in Sofia, Bulgaria. 
I have a passion for web design and love to create for web and mobile devices. I also enjoy crossing back and forth between UX, graphic design and front-end development.
