Hey there ðŸ‘‹, 
I'm Hristina ðŸ‘§ - a designer and an illustrator. Iâ€™m an optimist, an environmentalist and I will be more things yet to come.

My graphic and web design side is all about creating visually appealing art pieces and user-friendly interfaces, while the illustration one is creating magical drawings that make the people smile. I really love poster designs, collages, typography, and basically everything thatâ€™s connected to visual communication and I'm trying to spread dreams and happiness, one sketch at a time.ðŸ’«
